  and for secondary buttons)

  and for primary buttons/link colours)

  A blackletter font used for headings, to help convey the dark academic theme used.

#### Deployment

##### Heroku

The project was deployed to Heroku using the following steps...

1.

##### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository, we make a copy of the original repository on
our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original
repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [jordancrouch/read-between-the-vines](https://github.com/jordancrouch/read-between-the-vines/)
   repository.
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings"
   Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the
   [jordancrouch/read-between-the-vines](https://github.com/jordancrouch/read-between-the-vines/)
   repository.
2. Under the repository name, click "Code".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Code", click on the "HTTPS" tab
   and copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the
   cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/jordancrouch/read-between-the-vines.git
   ```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

   ```sh
   TODO: Paste clone output
   ```
